<ol class="lst-stps">
    <li>
    <h3>Provide your email address to register for email notifications</h3>
    <p>The email address you provide is the one we will use to tell you that important changes were made on your account or that you have new mail to view in My Account.</p>
    <p>There are many ways to register to receive email notifications from the CRA:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>register for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a> and you will be prompted to provide an email address</li>
	<li>sign in to My Account and you will be prompted to provide an email address if you don’t already have one on file</li>
	<li>provide your email address when you file a return with NETFILE software</li>
	<li>enter your email address on a paper income tax and benefit return that you send to the CRA</li>
	<li>provide your email address to your tax preparer who is filling out Form T183 or who uses EFILE</li>
	<li>contact Individual Income Tax and Trust Enquiries by phone</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Review the terms and conditions</h3>
    <p>To view the terms of use, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/terms-email-notifications.html">Terms of use for email notifications</a>.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Choose your notification preferences</h3>
   	<p>You may choose to receive eligible CRA mail electronically or by paper. You can update your correspondence option by signing in to My Account and selecting “Notification preferences.” For details, see <a href="h-2">Choosing your notification preferences</a>.</p>
	  
  </li>
	
    <li>
    <h3>Receive your confirmation email</h3>
    <p>Once you register or update your email address, we will send a confirmation email to the address you gave us. Depending on how you registered or updated your email address, you should receive your confirmation email within the following timelines:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>immediately</strong>&nbsp;if you registered or updated your email through My Account</li>
	<li><strong>within eight business days</strong>&nbsp;if you provided your email on your electronic return (using NETFILE or an EFILE service provider)</li>
	<li><strong>within four to six weeks</strong>&nbsp;if you provided your email on a paper income tax and benefit return</li>
	</ul>
    <p>If you do not get a confirmation email, sign in to My Account and check the email address on your profile. If the email address is wrong, update it. If it is correct, check your junk mail folder for an email from the CRA.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Keep your email address up to date</h3>
   	<p>Once you are registered for email notifications, you can update your email address by signing in to My Account and selecting “Notification preferences”, or you can complete any of the options above with a new email address. You can only have one email address on file at a time.</p>
	<p>Most mail that is eligible for electronic delivery will no longer be printed and mailed. All CRA mail available in My Account will be presumed to have been received on the date that the email notification is sent. You are responsible for making sure we have your correct email address at all times. </p>    
  </li>
  </ol>

<h3>Email address requirement for My Account</h3>   
<p>My Account users are required to have an email address on file with the CRA to help protect their accounts from fraudulent activity. This security feature ensures that you receive email notifications when important changes are made on your account.</p>
<p>While some email notifications will be mandatory to ensure the security of your account, such as when your address or direct deposit information is changed, you will be able to choose to receive additional optional notifications, such as when you have uncashed cheques.</p>
<p>This security feature will not affect your preferred method of receiving CRA mail. You will have the option to receive mail either by paper or an email notification when you have new mail to view in My Account.</p>
<p>If you are new to My Account, you will be asked to provide your email address as part of the registration process.</p>

<h2>Choosing your notification preferences</h2>
<p>Once you have provided the CRA with an email address, we will send you email notifications when there are <strong>changes or updates</strong> related to the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your address</li>
<li>Your direct deposit information</li>
<li>Your marital status</li>
<li>Your authorized representative</li>
<li>Your personal identification number</li>
<li>Your Multi-factor authentication enrolment</li>
<li>Your CRA user ID and password</li>
<li>Your account lockout status</li>
<li>Your SimpleFile by Phone automated phone service invitation</li>
<li>Mail sent to you by the CRA has been returned, meaning you need to update your mailing address</li>
<li>New CRA mail to view in My Account (your correspondence preference must be set to “Electronic mail”)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also choose to receive <strong>electronic mail and additional email notifications</strong> when there are changes or updates related to the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have new mail available to view in your account</li>
<li>Your T1 returns or reassessments</li>
<li>Your tax information slip(s) are posted</li>
<li>Your Disability tax credit application</li>
<li>Your submitted documents</li>
<li>Your uncashed cheques</li>
<li>Your Canada child benefit application</li>
</ul>
	   
<h3>Viewing your mail after receiving a notification</h3>
<p>To view CRA mail online, you must be registered for My Account. All CRA mail available in My Account will be presumed to have been received on the date that the email notification is sent. Most mail that is eligible for electronic delivery will no longer be printed and mailed.</p>
<p>If your correspondence preferences are set to “Electronic mail,” you will receive an email notification when you have new mail from the CRA to view in My Account. You will not receive a paper copy in the mail.</p>
<p>You may be able to view the following CRA mail online:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notices of assessment</li>
<li>Notices of reassessment</li>
<li>Benefit notices</li>
<li>Adjustment notices</li>
<li>Instalment reminders</li>
<li>Letters asking for information and documentation for some programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The CRA adds more items to our email notification service every year. However, some mail cannot be sent electronically and will continue to be mailed on paper. If you need a paper copy of your electronic mail, you can sign in to My Account and print it.</p>

<h3>Getting your CRA mail by paper</h3>
<p>If you still want to receive your mail from the CRA by paper, make sure “Electronic mail” is <strong>not ticked</strong> in your correspondence preferences. Your mail will still be available to view in My Account, but you will not receive an email notification about it.</p>


<h3>Getting email notifications even if you are not registered</h3>
	<p>You might receive an email notification from the CRA for other reasons, even if you are not registered for email notifications.</p>
	<p>For example, if you included an email address on your original audit enquiry submission form, we will email you when our response is available for you to view in My Account. Refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/audit-enquiries-businesses.html">Audit enquiries</a></p>


<h2>Making sure a notification is from the CRA</h2>
	<p>Emails sent from the CRA’s email notification service will have the sender name <strong>Canada Revenue Agency / <span lang="fr">Agence du Revenu du Canada</span></strong>.</p>
	<p>The CRA’s email notifications will not do the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ask you for personal or financial information</li>
		<li>Request payment by prepaid credit cards or gift cards</li>
		<li>Use aggressive language or tone</li>
		<li>Threaten arrest or to send police</li>
	</ul>
